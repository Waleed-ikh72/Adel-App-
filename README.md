# Traffic Solution Using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project, developed as part of the **SDAIA T5 Capstone**, offers an AI-powered traffic management system designed to address the growing traffic congestion and road safety challenges in Saudi Arabia. Aligned with Vision 2030, the solution utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning models to optimize traffic flow, detect violations, and enhance overall road safety.

By combining models like YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and PaddleOCR for license plate recognition, the system provides real-time monitoring and dynamic traffic signal adjustments based on vehicle density at intersections. The project also integrates a violation detection system that automatically identifies vehicles crossing lanes illegally, notifying violators via automated email, which helps law enforcement efforts.

## Key Features

- **Vehicle Detection**: YOLOv8 detects vehicles in real time with high accuracy, categorizing vehicles like cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes.
- **License Plate Recognition**: PaddleOCR is used for detecting and reading license plates, ensuring that violators are properly identified.
- **Traffic Signal Optimization**: The system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timing based on vehicle density at intersections, improving traffic flow.
- **Violation Detection**: Smart cameras monitor lane-crossing violations, with automatic notifications sent to violators, reducing manual law enforcement efforts.

## Methodology
The system processes data collected from various sources, including Kaggle, Roboflow, and social media platforms. The dataset includes annotated images of vehicles and license plates, with post-augmentation leading to over 1,900 images. YOLOv8 was used to train the models, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 95% for vehicle detection and 68% for license plates.

### Traffic Density Model
Using Roboflow, a model was trained to analyze vehicle density by categorizing cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes. The model was fine-tuned to improve accuracy and optimize traffic signal allocation based on vehicle types and traffic levels at intersections.

### Violation Detection
We trained the YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s models to detect lane violations. The system also incorporates PaddleOCR for accurate license plate recognition. Violations are stored in an SQLite3 database, which maintains violator details, including vehicle images and license plate information.

## Deployment
The system is deployed using a **Streamlit app** on Hugging Face to leverage GPU processing for real-time traffic monitoring. Violatorsâ€™ data is stored in SQLite3, and email notifications are sent regarding violations and associated fines.

## Results and Impact
The model has achieved a high level of accuracy in vehicle detection (81%) and violation identification (79%-91%). By addressing traffic congestion and improving law enforcement, this solution supports the goals outlined in **Saudi Vision 2030**, contributing to smarter and safer urban transportation systems.

## Future Work

- **Predictive Vehicle Motion**: Developing an advanced camera system that anticipates vehicle movements to further improve traffic flow and safety.
- **Pedestrian Safety**: Enhancing pedestrian safety at crosswalks by integrating people-counting technology to optimize the timing of walk signals.
- **Red-Light Violation Detection**: Implementing a system to monitor and deter vehicles from running red lights at busy intersections.
